# 🎄 🎅 🎄 Advent of code 2023 🎄 🎅 🎄

My solutions to Advent of Code 2023

I will be using TypeScript/JavaScript/NodeJS mostly

Most of these will be the initial submission, before any refactoring.

## Setup and running code

### CLI

- `yarn`

- run `npm link`

- create .env file and add the `AOC_SESSION` variable - can be found by logging into the adventofcode website, then checking cookies for the session cookie and copy the value

- `aoc init` - then pass in the year and day to fetch the challenge details from the website and save to markdown and prepare template files

### Running a days files

`yarn day -d 01` will run the day 1 files. will default to using the real input data (rather than test). Can pass the `-t` flag for test data - or `-r `for real input data

## The Story

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
